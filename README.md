# Lecture-Cram-Planner-v2.0

A program designed to help you catch up on lectures that you are currently behind on by generating a timetable showing you how you can catch up with your current schedule as well as an estimation of how long it will take if you begin on Monday of that week.

## Notes

- The deployed version doesn't include latest commit as I am working on improving the catch-up day calculation, and a feature where you can select a custom day to start catching up.
- The program runs slowly as I use a free plan for a deployment service (Render)
